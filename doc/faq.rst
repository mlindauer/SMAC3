F.A.Q.
======

.. rubric:: SMAC cannot be imported.

Try to either run SMAC from SMAC's root directory
or try to run the installation first.

.. rubric:: pyrfr raises cryptic import errors.

Ensure that the gcc used to compile the pyrfr is the same as used for linking during execution.
This often happens with Anaconda -- see `Installation <installation.html>`_ for a solution.

.. rubric:: My target algorithm is not accepted, when using the scenario-file.

Make sure that your algorithm accepts commandline options as provided by *SMAC*.
Refer to `commandline execution <basic_usage.html#commandline>`_ for details on how to wrap your algorithm.

You can also run SMAC with :code:`--verbose DEBUG` to see how *SMAC* tried to call your algorithm.

.. rubric:: I discovered a bug/have criticism or ideas on *SMAC*. Where should I report to?

*SMAC* uses the `GitHub issue-tracker <https://github.com/automl/SMAC3/issues>`_ to take care of bugs and questions. If you
experience problems with *SMAC*, try to provide a full error report with all the
typical information (OS, version, console-output, minimum working example, ...).
This makes it a lot easier to reproduce the error and locate the problem.
